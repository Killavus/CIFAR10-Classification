# CIFAR10 Classification Problem Solving

We're using convolutional neural networks here, but there are some other
approaches shown.

## Prerequisites

You need a scientific Python to run this code. I recommend Anaconda Python,
available [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

## Setup

Download the CIFAR10 data set and put it to `datasets/` directory.
Run `source set-env.sh` to load appropriate libraries and set data set directory
correctly.

## Run

Run `python classifier.py` to run the classifier.
