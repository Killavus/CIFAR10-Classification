* moved the dropout layer between dense & softmax. changed the second conv2d
nonlinearity to tanh -> REDUCED ACCURACY (~73%)
* changed the second conv2d nonlinearity to rectify -> REDUCED ACCURACY (~73,5%)
* increased number of filters on second conv2d layer -> ~74%
* moved dropout after Conv2D again, reduced features map count to 32 again ->
76%
